* Welcome to the CTF 6502 challenge!                                  *
*                                                                     *
* This 6502 assembly program should process the flag data and make it *
* readable, but the data in the memory dump looks corrupted.          *
* I guess there's a bug in the assembly program...                    *
* or could it be in the emulator?                                     *
