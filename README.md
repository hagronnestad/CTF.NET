#### Welcome to the CTF 6502 challenge!
In this CTF challenge, the MOS 6502 has returned. This time it doesn't power a home video game console or computer system like the Nintendo Entertainment System or the Commodore 64.

This time it's hiding our flag! Let's travel back in time to the beginning of the home computer revolution, whip out or programming manual and get our hands busy with some good old 6502-assembly.

Implement the missing opcode in the `OPCODE_0x49`-method and fix the machine code in the `program`-variable.

When you're done you should be able to read the flag in the memory dump at memory address `0x0040`.

Good luck, I'll see you in the future!
